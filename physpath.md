#A Time Dependent Path For Brewing A Theoretical Physicist
Most of this stuff is from
[How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~Gadda001/goodtheorist/languages.html),
which I modified slightly according to a timeline of myself and, of
course, to a proper pace to be ajusted later.

##Current Stage Emphasis
1. Languages  
   German; ablilty of basic scientific listening and reading; time
stamp:from 2014-26 to within this year (2014).
2. Primary Mathematics  
   mathematical methods; time stamp: from 2014-27 to 2014-33.

##Languages
No specitfic time given here.  
+ ~~English is a prerequisite, which can be count as mastered at this
   stage. If further needed, writting should be the part to be
   sharpened. Greek letters are used a lot. Master their names.~~
+ French, German are not all that necessary but considered good
   practice.
+ Japanese, Russian are the last part to conquer.

##Primary Mathematics
Primary math: ~~math I, linear algebra~~, mathematical methods and very
elementary functional analysis.  
Time scale: from 2014-27 to 2014-36.  
* Set theory: open sets, compact spaces.  
   Topology.(You may be surprised to learn that they do play a role indeed in physics!)
* ~~Algebraic equations. Approximation techniques. Series expansions: the Taylor series.~~
* ~~Solving equations with complex numbers. Trigonometry.~~
* ~~Infinitesimals. Differentiation. Integration. Differential equations. Linear equations.~~n
* The Fourier transformation. The use of complex numbers. Convergence of series.
* The complex plane. Cauchy theorems and contour integration (now this is fun).
* The Gamma function (enjoy studying its properties). Generalized functions.
* Gaussian integrals. Probability theory.
* Partial differential equations. Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

##Classical Mechanics
Elementary mechanics: ~~Newtonian~~, Lagrangean, Hamiltonian.  
Time scale: from 2014-27 to 2014-38.  
* ~~Static mechanics (forces, tension)~~; hydrostatics; ~~Newton’s Laws~~.
* ~~The elliptical orbits of planets. The many-body system.~~
* The action principle. Hamilton’s equations. The Lagrangean.
* The harmonic oscillator. The pendulum.
* Poisson’s brackets.
* Wave equations. Liquids and gases. The Navier-Stokes
  equations. Viscosity and friction.

##Optics & Electronics
Classical and Quantum Optics & very basic things about electronic
circuits: another perspect to look at _Electromagnetism_.  
Time scale: electronics from 2014-27 to 2014-30, and optics 2014-31 to
2014-38.  
- Ohm’s law, capacitors, inductors, using complex numbers to calculate their effects
- Transistors, diodes (how these actually work comes later)
- Fraction and reflection
- Lenses and mirrors
- The telescope and the microscope
- Introduction to wave propagation
- Doppler effect
- Huijgens’ principle of wave superposition
- Wave fronts
- Caustics

##Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics
Yet another SM: should involve some quantum physics.  
Time scale: from 2014-33 to 2014-44.  
- The first, second and third laws of thermodynamics
- The Boltzmann distribution
- The Carnot cycle. Entropy. Heat engines
- Phase transitions. Thermodynamical models

  Ising Model to later)

##Electromagnetism
Intermediate level electrodynamics: Maxwell’s Theory.  
Time scale: from 2014-39 to 2014-50.  
- Homogeneous and inhomogeneous
- Maxwell’s laws in a medium. Boundaries. Solving the equations in:

  2. In a box (wave guides)  
  3. At boundaries (fraction and reflection)  
- The vector potential and gauge invariance (extremely important)
- Emission and absorption on EM waves (antenna)
