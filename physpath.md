#A Time Dependent Path For Brewing Theoretical Physicist
Most of this stuff is from
[How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~Gadda001/goodtheorist/languages.html),
which I modified slightly according to a timeline of myself and, of
course, to a proper pace to be ajusted later.

##Current Stage Emphasis
1. Languages
... German; ablilty of basic scientific listening and reading; time
stamp:from 2014-26 to within this year (2014).
2. Primary Mathematics
... mathematical methods; time stamp: from 2014-27 to 2014-33.

##Languages
No specitfic time given here.
1. ~~English is a prerequisite, which can be count as mastered at this
   stage. If further needed, writting should be the part to be
   sharpened. Greek letters are used a lot. Master their names.~~
2. French, German are not all that necessary but considered good
   practice.
3. Japanese, Russian are the last part to conquer.

##Primary Mathematics
Primary math: ~~math I, linear algebra~~, mathematical methods and very
elementary functional analysis.

Time scale: from 2014-27 to 2014-36.
* Set theory: open sets, compact spaces.
... Topology.You may be surprised to learn that they do play a role indeed in physics!
* ~~Algebraic equations. Approximation techniques. Series expansions: the Taylor series.~~
* ~~Solving equations with complex numbers. Trigonometry.~~
* ~~Infinitesimals. Differentiation. Integration. Differential equations. Linear equations.~~
* The Fourier transformation. The use of complex numbers. Convergence of series.
* The complex plane. Cauchy theorems and contour integration (now this is fun).
* The Gamma function (enjoy studying its properties). Generalized functions.
* Gaussian integrals. Probability theory.
* Partial differential equations. Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

5. [Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics](http://book.douban.com/subject/2880541/)

##Classical Mechanics
Elementary mechanics: ~~Newtonian~~, Lagrangean, Hamiltonian.

Time scale: from 2014-27 to 2014-38.
* ~~Static mechanics (forces, tension)~~; hydrostatics; ~~Newton’s Laws~~.
* ~~The elliptical orbits of planets. The many-body system.~~
* The action principle. Hamilton’s equations. The Lagrangean.
* The harmonic oscillator. The pendulum.
* Poisson’s brackets.
* Wave equations. Liquids and gases. The Navier-Stokes
  equations. Viscosity and friction.
