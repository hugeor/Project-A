\section{The Axion Theory}
%page 1
\begin{frame}{From Strong-CP Problem}
Postulated roughly 4 decades ago, axion elegantly solves the "strong-CP" problem by presenting a quasisymmetry $U_{PQ}(1)$, i.e.
$$\bar{\theta} = \theta - arg \, det(m_1,m_2, \ldots, m_n) - \frac{a(x)}{f_a},$$
where $a(x)$ is the axion field, $f_a = v_a/N$ is called the axion decay constant, $v_a$ is the vacuum expectation value,
which spontaneously breaks $U_{PQ}(1)$, and $N$ is an integer that expresses the color anomaly of $U_{PQ}(1)$ symmetry.
\\
\vspace{1cm}
The nonperturbative effects then produce a effective potential $V(\bar{\theta})$, whose minimum is at $\bar{\theta} = 0$.
\end{frame}
%page 2
\begin{frame}{Axion Parameters}
The axion mass is given in terms of $f_a$ by$$
m_a \simeq 0.6 eV \frac{10^7GeV}{f_a}.$$
All the axion couplings are inversely proportional to $f_a$.
\\One in particular is the axion coupling to two
photons:$$
\mathcal{L}_{a \gamma \gamma} = -(\frac{\alpha}{\pi} \frac{g_{\gamma}}{f_a}) a \vec{E} \vec{B},$$
where $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are the usual electric and magnetic
fields, $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, and $g_{\gamma}$
is a modeldependent coefficient of order 1.
\end{frame}
%page 3 
\begin{frame}{A Brief on Constraints}
A priori, the value of $v_a$, and thus $m_a$, is arbitrary. At present, the combined limits rule out axions heavier than about $3 \times 10^{-3}eV$.
\begin{itemize}
\item If the axion is heavier than $1 MeV$, and decays quickly into $e^+ e^-$ (lifetime of order $10^{-11} sec$ or less), then it is ruled out by negative searches for rare particle decays such as $\pi^+ \rightarrow a(e^+ e^-)+e^++\nu_e$, whose rates are well known.
\item If lifetime is greater than $10^{-11} sec$, they are severely constrained by negative searches in beam dumps. Since in a beam dump, many different process involving independent couplings should add up incoherently and can't all vanish. Many such experiment thus ruled out mass range down to about $50 keV$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%page 4
\begin{frame}{A Brief on Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item Emission of no-rescattering axions provides an efficient way of cooling stars. Thus the abundance of red giants ruled out the mass range $0.5 eV \lesssim m_a \lesssim 200keV$ for KSVZ type. This range extends as the coupling to $e^-$ grows.
\item The terrestrial neutrino signal from SN 1987a eliminates the range $3 \times 10^{-3} eV \lesssim m_a \lesssim 2 eV$. The observation is consistent with theoretical expectations based on the premise that the core cools solely by emission of neutrinos suggests that axions need to be very weekly coupled. (NB: This constraint is relatively axion model independent.)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%page 5
\begin{frame}{Axions and Cosmology}
At a critical time $t_1 = m_a^{-1}(t_1)$, temperature of order $f_a (\sim 1 GeV)$ , a phase transition occurs in which the $U_{PQ}(1)$ symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. This is called the PQ phase transition, when the nonperturbative effects that produce the effective potential $V(\bar{\theta})$ are suppressed, the axion is massless,
and all values of $\langle a(x) \rangle$ are equally likely. After the transition, the axion field starts to oscillate in response to the axion mass turn-on.\\
We distinguish two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Inflation occurs with reheat temperature less than the PQ transition temperature;
\item inflation occurs with reheat temperature higher than the PQ transition temperature (equivalently, for our purposes, inflation does not occur at all). 
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%page 6
\begin{frame}{Case I}
Homogenized by inflation, the initial amplitude depends on how far from zero the axion field is at $t_1$. The contribution to $\Omega_0$ in terms of $\rho_c$ is$$
\Omega_a = \frac{\rho_a(t_0)}{\rho_c} = \frac{1}{6}\alpha^2(t_1)(\frac{f_a}{10^{12}GeV})^{7/6}(\frac{0.7}{h_{100}})^2,$$
where $\alpha(t_1) = a(t_1)/f_a$ is the initial misaligment angle.\\
\vspace{1cm}
NB: $\Omega_a$ can be supressed if $a(t_1) \sim 0$. \\
NNB: This contribution is also called \alert{vacuum realignment}.
\end{frame}
%page 7
\begin{frame}{Case II}
An reasonable assumption, in this case, would be after $t_1$, each axion string turns into boundary of \alert{1} domain wall. Thus  contributions to $\Omega_0$ are as follows: (1)from axions that were radiated before $t_1$; (2)from the decay of walls after $t_1$; (3)from vacuum realignment.\\
Now if we introduce a parameter $\xi$ to discribe the average distance between axion strings at time $t$ as $\xi t$, and if we take $\xi = 1$, we have\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\Omega_a &= \Omega^{vac}+\Omega^{d.w.}+\Omega^{str}\\
&= (0.5-3.0)(\frac{f_a}{10^{12}})^{7/6}(\frac{0.7}{h_{100}})^2
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}
%page 8
\begin{frame}{Summary of Constraints}
If we plug in known $\Omega_0$ as $\Omega_a$, an open mass range at $1-100 \mu eV$ is obtained.\\
Combining privious constraints, we have the following fig:

\begin{frame}{Primakoff Effect}
The Primakoff effect is the resonant production of neutral pseudoscalar mesons by high-energy photons interacting with an atomic nucleus. \\
For axions, in a strong magnetic field, their convertion to photons can be detected theoretically.  
\begin{figure}
    \caption{Feynman diagram for Primakoff effect, where $e$ for electrons, $I$ for ions.}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{prima}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}
%page 2
\begin{frame}{General Detector Properties}
When a frequency $\omega=2 \pi f$ of a cavity mode equals $m_a$, axions convert resonantly into photons. The power from axion-to-photon conversion
on resonance is found to be
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P_a &= (\frac{\alpha}{\pi} \frac{g_\gamma}{f_a})^2 V B_0^2 \rho_a C \frac{1}{m_a} Min(Q_L,Q_a)\\
&=0.5\times10^{-26}W(\frac{V}{500 liter})(\frac{B_0}{7 T})^2 C (\frac{g_\gamma}{0.36})^2\\
&\times (\frac{\rho_a}{\frac{1}{2}\times10^{-24}g/cm^3})\times (\frac{m_a}{2\pi(GHz)})Min(Q_L,Q_a),
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $V$ is the volume if the cavity, $Q_L$ is the cavity's loaded quality factor, $Q_a = 10^{16}$ is the Q factor for galactic halo axion signal, $\rho_a$ is the density of galactic halo axions on Earth, $C$ is a mode-dependent form factor.\\
For a cylindrical cavity with  the $TM_{010}$ mode yields the largest form factor with $C \approx 0.69$.
\end{frame}
%page 3
\begin{frame}{General Detector Properties}
As a cavity scans over the
possible axion mass range, the scan rate (aka, SNR) is determined
by the amount of time it takes for a possible axion signal
to be detected over the microwave cavityâ€™s intrinsic noise, or mathematically,$$
SNR = \frac{P_a}{\bar{P_N}}\sqrt{Bt} = \frac{P_a}{k_BT_S}\sqrt{\frac{t}{B}},$$
where $\bar{P_N}= k_BBT_S$ is the cavity noise power, $B$ is the bandwidth, and $T_S$
is the sum of the physical
temperature of the cavity plus the noise temperature of
the microwave receiver.\\
At a given SNR, we have a useful logarithmic scan rate relation as follows,
$$\frac{1}{f}\frac{df}{dt} \propto (B_0^2V)^2\frac{1}{T_S^2}.$$
\end{frame}
%page 4
\begin{frame}{First-gerneration Experiments}
First-g eneration microwave cavity experiments demonstrated the
feasibility of the technique over a significant range of
frequencies, but fell short in power sensitivity by 100â€“
1000 in efforts to detect halo axions with plausible model couplings, due to their \alert{small volumes}
and relatively \alert{high noise temperatures}.\\

The CARRACK (Cosmic Axion Research using Rydberg Atoms in a resonant Cavity in
Kyoto) experiment, rather than amplifiers, opted to develop a Rydberg-atom
based single-quantum detector.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Rydberg Atoms}
  Currently studied Rydberg atoms experimentally have $10<n<150$, which makes
transitions between states fall in the microwave region ($\Delta E_{100} \sim 7GHz$).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The energy levels of nonhydrogenic alkaki atoms, which depend on the angular momentum $\ell$
    through the number $\delta_{\ell}$ are given
    by $$E_{n,\ell}=\frac{\mathcal{R}}{(n-\delta_{\ell})^2}=\frac{\mathcal{R}}{\tilde{n}^2}.$$
  \item As a result of the coupling of all of the atoms to the spatially
    coherent field, a collective atom systom formed. Due to
    which, the coupling $\Omega$ between the cavity and the atoms is replaced
    by $\Omega_N=\Omega \sqrt{N}$.

    \item Guiding field method to avoid the rotation of electric field and
      increase absorption probability of photons.
    \item A spatially collimated bunched packets of Rydberg atomic beam (by
      laser cooling) time varying electric field will be applied to compensate
      the stray electric field.

\section{A Summary}
%page 1
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Summary}
  Although the expected axion convertion power is remarkably weak, the
  technology development so far has been very promising.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The new microstrip technique for coupling the signal into a SQUID has
    extended the application of SQUIDâ€™s as high-gain amplifiers into the
    $1-GHz$ region. And new SQUID layouts for higher frequency are under
    consideration. 
  \item Higher-frequency operation poses no new conceptual problem for the
    Rydberg-atom single-quantum technique. 
  \end{itemize}
  Taking a optimistic point of view,  the technology will soon be in hand to
  either find the axion with high probability, if it exists, or if not,
  exclude it.
